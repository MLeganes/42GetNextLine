Calling your functionget_next_line in a loop will then allow you to read the text available
 on the file descriptor one line at a time until the end of it.

Your function should return the line that has just been read. If there is nothingelse
 to read or if an error has occurred it should return NULL.
  
Make sure that your function behaves well when it reads from a file and when itreads
from the standard input.
